C# self study project

This is a simple calculator I have programmed as part of my self study. User is prompted to enter two numbers and then to select whether they want to add, divide, multiply or substract. Result is then displayed based on the selection.

Every input has exception handling, to prevent crashes after wrong input. It allows user to try enter new value.
